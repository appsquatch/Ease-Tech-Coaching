# Ease Technology Coaches
Empower yourself with coaching sessions to learn to use your technology the way you want. Our web app connects users with experts in setting up and troubleshooting their everyday devices such as smartphones and computers; saving them from the runaround.

## Task 
Create an easy to use single page application to allow users to easily find pricing and schedule a coaching appointment. We went with a minimalistic design and integrated suttle animations through Animate.CSS to help guide the user to relevent sections. Due to the services provided, some of the users using the site may not be very experienced making appointments online. In order to make sure it was easy to use, we tested and modified the design with our target audience's feedback to simplify the expereince. 


## Future Development
* Automate the process of appointment assignment to the vendors that sign up to provide coaching sessions.
* Create online profile to show upcoming appointments and allow users to view, modify and cancel appoitments online.
* Transition to a mobile app for iOS and Android.
